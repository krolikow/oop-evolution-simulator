# Evolution simulator

Project based on instructions at: https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/blob/master/proj1/Readme.md

The project presents an evolution process among animals that lives on special map. Animals (represented by rabbits) can eat carrots to increase their energy level, move, reproduct and of course die.

## Settings

It is possible to set custom parameters at the beginning of the simulation:

## Statistics

It's also possible to view statistics such as average children number, average life span, average energy level or genotype dominant. Statistics can be exported to csv file.
